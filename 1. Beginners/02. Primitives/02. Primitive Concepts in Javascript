Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const



JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement



JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	Example	Same As
=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y
/=	x /= y	x = x / y
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
**=	x **= y	x = x ** y



Boolean Values
Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE

False Values are:
false
null
undefined
0
-0
NaN
'', "", ``, (empty strings)
For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.




Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

==	equal to	x == 8	false	
x == 5	true	
x == "5"	true	
===	equal value and equal type	x === 5	true	
x === "5"	false	
!=	not equal	x != 8	true	
!==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
x !== "5"	true	
x !== 8	true	
>	greater than	x > 8	false	
<	less than	x < 8	true	
>=	greater than or equal to	x >= 8	false	
<=	less than or equal to	x <= 8	true




Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Given that x = 6 and y = 3, the table below explains the logical operators:

Operator
&&	and	(x < 10 && y > 1) is true	
||	or	(x == 5 || y == 5) is false	
!	not	!(x == y) is true





JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.

A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

Example
let text = "John Doe";






Number Methods
Methods that can be used to convert strings to numbers:

Method	
Number()	Returns a number, converted from its argument
parseFloat()	Parses a string and returns a floating point number
parseInt()	Parses a string and returns an integer
